Hookie is a simple web service that listens for organization events to know when a repo is created. When the repo is created, Hookie automates the protection of the main branch In addition, it notifies you with an @mention in an issue withing your repo that illustrates the protections that were added.


## Setup
- Run the install.sh script on RedHat 8.6 (Oopta):
- Contains the following dependencies
  - Python3
  - pip3
  - flask
  - ngrok

- Configure webhooks in Github
- Configure Ngrok

- Notes
  - Disabled firewall for testing
- Add the following to the hookie.py script
  - github username
  - github token
  - [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#installation)
  - [ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started)
- Set GH_TOKEN as an environment variable with a value that corresponds to a GitHub Token (ie. `export GH_TOKEN=208923487234780287128091`)
- Set the user value in app.py
- Start the local web service via `flask run --host=0.0.0.0 &`
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
- Start the forwarding service via `./ngrok http 5000 &`
- Note the forwarding address (ie. `https://cfe6d829.ngrok.io` in the output of the ngrok application)
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
- Set up a WebHook in the desired GitHub organization [example](https://github.com/buzzmoto-org/REPO/settings/hooks)
  - Note that the Payload URL should match the forwarding address from [ngrok](https://blahblah.ngrok.io)
  - Select the individual events radio button and check repositories
  - Content type should be application/json
  - Save the Webhook
- Create a repository
- See that branch protection and an issue was created for the repo!

## Bugs and improvements
- Payloads are capped at 25 MB. If your event generates a larger payload, a webhook will not be fired. This may happen, for example, on a create event if many branches or tags are pushed at once. We suggest monitoring your payload size to ensure delivery. See [webhooks docs](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/)
- There is a 1 second Delay built in to the code which is NOT ideal. It seems the code is checking for the main branch before it is finished creating.
- This could be done with AWS Lambda and an API Gateway.
