# Hookie - GitHub solution with webhooks

Hookie is a simple web service that listens for organization events to know when a repo is created. When the repo is created, Hookie automates the protection of the main branch In addition, it notifies you with an @mention in an issue withing your repo that illustrates the protections that were added.
